                <h2>What is SARt ?</h2>
                <p>Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR, is a type of remote sensing technology that differs from traditional optical imagery.
                     It operates by emitting its own energy and measuring the energy reflected back from the Earth's surface.
                     SAR data is distinct in that it focuses on surface characteristics like structure and moisture rather than visual images.
                      Radar sensors use wavelengths ranging from centimeters to meters, which gives them unique capabilities such as the ability to penetrate clouds.
                      The length of the sensor's antenna affects spatial resolution, and SAR systems utilize synthetic aperture techniques to achieve higher resolutions.
